Hi, I'm Semand. Welcome to my structLife blog where I advocate for a structured lifestyle empowered by science and practical considerations. 

For an intro into my core concept, explore [Health & Legacy: 84h/w Each](/about-2023-11-22-health-and-legacy-84-hours-per-week-each)

Here is my backstory...

For almost 30 years, I've been in charge of Mobile Backhaul networks, a role that includes high stress and health challenges, which I was trying to overcome in numerous attempts. Public stereotypes, such as 'if you can't change by 40, you can't at 50 either', made a lifestyle change seem impossible.

However, a shift in the Covid-19 work dynamics (work from home), combined with my new Health-Legacy framework, became a game-changer. Through audiobooks, podcasts, and research, I got into the best shape of my life, rediscovering a vitality I hadn't felt since my teens.

In 2-3 years, through simple behaviour changes, I've shed 30kg off an initial weight of 100kg, reduced my body fat from 26% to 14%, brought my BMI down from 32 to 22 and decreased my vascular age by 10-12 years compared to where it was 3 years ago. Along with these and other measurable changes, I have regained the quick recovery ability and the lightness of my teenage years, and I no longer use any medications or supplements.
