Hi, I'm Andrejs. Welcome to my structLife blog where I advocate for a structured lifestyle empowered by science and practical considerations. I manage engineers at work and analyze data about myself using various mobile health apps & research as a hobby. My background is bioinformatics, which means I use machine learning and programming with biological data.

I have created my own Health-Legacy Balance framework, offering an alternative to the traditional Work-Life balance. 

For an intro into my core concept, explore [Health & Legacy: 84h/w Each](/about-2023-11-22-health-and-legacy-84-hours-per-week-each)
