#  \#1a Extra: Heart Rate Variability  

#### Last Updated: December 03, 2023

![An infographic explaining Heart Rate Variability (HRV). At the top, two contrasting states are depicted: "fight or flight" with an increase in heartbeats shown on the left, and "rest and digest" with a decrease in heartbeats on the right. In the center, there's a heart with a heartbeat line indicating variability. The bottom half of the image features a graph with a red shaded area showing HRV decreasing with age; lower HRV is labeled as "Bad" with associated risks, while higher HRV is "Good" and linked to health benefits. The website "structLife.com" is mentioned at the bottom.](../images/products/post-2023-12-03-heart-rate-variability-low-high-explained.png)

It came to my attention that a lot of people are confused about their HRV (Heart Rate Variability) values on their wearable devices. Many intuitively believe that a high and increasing HRV is bad. Attached is my attempt to explain it simply. 

To sum it up, the heart rate should be variable and able to accelerate and decelerate efficiently as needed. This adaptability allows the body to handle stress and then recover from it. 

Have you checked your HRV lately, and what does it say about your stress and recovery levels?
