After 40 months of consistent cold showers, I made the switch to ice baths. This change resulted in a noticeable improvement in my Heart Rate Variability (HRV), a key indicator of cardiovascular health and resilience.

HRV measures the variation in time between heartbeats, controlled by the autonomic nervous system (ANS). A higher HRV is often linked to a healthy cardiovascular system and better coping with stressful situations. A lower HRV may be an indicator of stress, mental health problems and cardiovascular diseases.

However, it’s important to note that HRV can be influenced by numerous factors and varies among individuals. 

The change was replacing my daily cold shower with an ice bath practice. This was the only change in my well-established morning routine, suggesting a correlation with the observed HRV improvements.

Looking for support of my experience, I found a study published in the *European Journal of Applied Physiology* (Sep 2023) investigating the effects of repeated cold-water immersion (CWI) after high-intensity exercises on cardiac-autonomic modulation, among other factors. This study found that post-exercise CWI (11-min; 11 °C) improved cardiac-autonomic modulation, which is crucial for adapting heart rate to different physiological states, like relaxation or physical exertion. My routine, involving an 11-minute ice bath at 6-10 °C after high-intensity interval exercises, is similar to the study's protocol. The switch from cold showers to ice baths was associated with an increase in my average monthly HRV, from about 50ms to 71ms and higher, with some daily averages reaching previously unseen values of 140ms and higher. 

Switching from daily cold showers to ice baths after high-intensity exercises has had a positive impact on my HRV. Although this is a personal experience and not scientific, it has proven effective for me in practice, which is my primary choice in choosing between ice baths and cold showers. It's important to note that practices like ice baths carry risks, including hypothermia, particularly for those inexperienced to extreme cold. Therefore, anyone considering similar changes should do so cautiously and ideally under the guidance of a health professional. As always, consult with a healthcare professional before beginning any new health routines.
