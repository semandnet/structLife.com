*"We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit."* - Aristotle


Throughout life's journey, we learn and practice, acquiring knowledge, skills, and qualifications. But unlike the records of achievements on our resumes, our knowledge and abilities can degrade if we don’t use them regularly. Considering that our weekly time is limited to 168 hours, we simply can't repeatedly do everything we've learned over the years. Our current set of skills can be identified by analyzing how we've been spending these hours every week over the past few years. 

As we age and perhaps approach significant milestones, like the 50th year of life, it becomes even more crucial to audit where our time is spent. For instance, I have over 10 years of programming experience in Java, but the last code I wrote in Java was 10 years ago and the same goes for a dozen other programming languages and technologies. Should I still associate myself with this experience, or should I simply strike it off and focus on what’s relevant now? For moving forward, it's essential to determine which skills are retained and which ones are left in the past.

By examining my professional activities, educational background, and numerous hobbies over many years, I tried to identify the activities that still make it into my weekly schedule and those that are fading away. In essence, I spend most of my spare time on communication in various languages and forms, research literacy, and habit formation.

These skills paved my way to the best shape of my entire life, according to health metrics I've tracked over the years. For myself, creating my 84h/84h Health vs Legacy balance framework using these three skills, became a game-changer. That's why I've chosen to focus my blog on Data-Driven Self-Management and Balancing Health-Legacy.
